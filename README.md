This was an exercise in the Udacity React Nanodegree.

The task was to create a game that shows an equation of the form X+Y+Z=P where X, Y, and Z should be random numbers, and P should be the proposed answer. The user can answer whether the equation is correct and a score of correct answers is displayed.  Every time the user answers a question, a new question that uses randomly generated numbers is displayed.
